PROJECT DELIVERABLES — ECommerce Website

This generated document collects core project artifacts derived from the provided screenshots and the repository contents. It is intended to be a single, easy-to-read deliverable for submission.

1. Project Summary
- Project: ECommerce Website (Pharmacy / E-commerce)
- Scope: Product browsing, search, add to cart, checkout with payments, order tracking, admin product management, prescription uploads, appointment booking and reporting.

2. Functional Overview (high-level)
- User actions: browse products, search products, view details, add to cart, upload prescription, checkout (shipping + payment), view orders, track status, book appointments, view appointments, download invoices.
- Admin actions: manage products (add/edit/delete), manage brands/categories, manage orders (view/update), verify prescriptions, manage users and doctors, generate reports (monthly/yearly), set appointment slots.

3. Function Points and Effort (derived from screenshots)
- Transaction function unadjusted UFP (from screenshot): 79
- Data function unadjusted UFP (from screenshot): 131
- Total UFP = 79 + 131 = 210

- General System Characteristics (GSC) total (TDI) from screenshot: 35
- Value Adjustment Factor (VAF) = 0.65 + (0.01 * TDI) = 0.65 + 0.35 = 1.00
- Adjusted Function Points (AFP) = UFP * VAF = 210 * 1.00 = 210

Effort estimate (example from screenshot):
- Productivity assumption: 20 FP per person-month (conservative for Python + React stack example in screenshot)
- Effort = AFP * (hours per FP) — screenshot used: 210 * 20 = 4200 person-hours
- With 8 hour workday, 4200 / 8 = 525 person-days
- For a 5-person team: 525 / 5 = 105 days ≈ 4.38 months → ~4 months

4. Project Schedule (extracted from screenshot)
- Project schedule shown as a 16-week allocation covering requirements, planning, analysis, design, coding, testing, and implementation. Weekly breakdown highlights:
  - Week 1–3: Requirements gathering
  - Week 2–4: Planning
  - Week 3–6: Analysis
  - Week 4–7: Design
  - Week 6–13: Coding
  - Week 8–14: Testing
  - Weeks 9–16: Implementation / deployment / UAT

5. Weekly Activities (summary from screenshots)
- Requirements: stakeholder meetings, collect user stories, SRS preparation
- Planning: scope, WBS, resource assignment
- Analysis: process models, DFDs, ER diagrams, dependency analysis
- Design: architecture, DB schema, UI mockups
- Coding: backend APIs, frontend UI, integration
- Testing: integration testing, functional/system testing, bug fixing
- Implementation: deployment, documentation, training, monitoring

6. Diagrams (what's in `diagrams/Activity_ECommerce.drawio`)
- Activity diagrams included inside the single `.drawio` file (added/updated):
  - User Registration (existing)
  - Place Order (existing)
  - Login (added)
  - Manage Product (added)
  - Search Product (added)
  - Add to Cart & Checkout (added)
  - View Order & Track Status (added)
  - Report Generation (added)

How to open: use diagrams.net/draw.io desktop or the VS Code draw.io extension.

7. How to run the Laravel project (quick guide)
Assumptions: you have PHP 8+, Composer, Node.js, npm/yarn, and a database (sqlite or MySQL).

Steps:
- Install dependencies:
  - `composer install`
  - `npm install` (or `pnpm install` / `yarn`)
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update DB credentials
- Generate app key:
  - `php artisan key:generate`
- Run migrations & seeders:
  - `php artisan migrate --seed`
- Build frontend assets:
  - `npm run build` (or `npm run dev` during development)
- Start local server:
  - `php artisan serve`

8. Deliverables included in this repo (generated)
- `generated/PROJECT_DELIVERABLES.md` (this file)
- Diagrams: `diagrams/Activity_ECommerce.drawio` (contains multiple diagrams)

9. Suggested next steps (optional)
- Export each `.drawio` diagram to PNG/PDF and add them to `diagrams/exports/` for submission.
- Create a dedicated SRS `docs/SRS.md` that expands each functional requirement with acceptance criteria.
- Add unit and feature tests for critical flows (checkout, order creation, auth).

If you'd like, I can now:
- Export PNGs for each diagram and place them under `diagrams/exports/`.
- Create a `docs/SRS.md` using the functional points table and screenshots as references.
- Update the repository `README.md` with the quick start steps.

Which of these should I do next? (I can proceed automatically if you want all of them.)
