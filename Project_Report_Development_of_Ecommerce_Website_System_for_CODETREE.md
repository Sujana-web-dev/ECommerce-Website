The authentication system implements Laravel's built-in authentication features with custom enhancements for role-based access control:

**User Model Implementation:**
```php
<?php
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    protected $fillable = [
        'name', 'email', 'password', 'role'
    ];

    protected $hidden = [
        'password', 'remember_token',
    ];

    public function isAdmin()
    {
        return $this->role === 'admin';
    }

    public function cartItems()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(CartItem::class);
    }

    public function orders()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Order::class);
    }
}
```

**Authentication Controller:**
```php
<?php
namespace App\Http\Controllers\Auth;

use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

class LoginController extends Controller
{
    public function authenticate(Request $request)
    {
        $credentials = $request->validate([
            'email' => 'required|email',
            'password' => 'required'
        ]);

        if (Auth::attempt($credentials)) {
            $request->session()->regenerate();
            
            if (Auth::user()->isAdmin()) {
                return redirect()->route('admindashboard');
            }
            
            return redirect()->route('dashboard');
        }

        return back()->withErrors([
            'email' => 'Invalid credentials provided.',
        ]);
    }
}
```

#### 5.2.2 Product Management System

**Product Model with Relationships:**
```php
<?php
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Product extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = [
        'name', 'amount', 'cat_id', 'details', 'image', 'stock'
    ];

    public function category()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(ProductCategory::class, 'cat_id');
    }

    public function isInStock()
    {
        return $this->stock > 0;
    }

    public function cartItems()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(CartItem::class);
    }

    public function orderItems()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(OrderItem::class);
    }
}
```

**Product Controller Implementation:**
```php
<?php
namespace App\Http\Controllers\Product;

use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use App\Models\Product;
use App\Models\ProductCategory;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class ProductController extends Controller
{
    public function addProduct()
    {
        $category = ProductCategory::all();
        return view('admin.product.add', [
            'category' => $category,
            'pageTitle' => 'Add Product',
        ]);
    }

    public function create(Request $request)
    {
        $request->validate([
            'name' => 'required|string|max:255',
            'cat_id' => 'required',
            'amount' => 'required|numeric',
            'details' => 'nullable|string',
            'image' => 'nullable|image|mimes:jpeg,png,jpg,gif|max:2048',
            'stock' => 'required|integer|min:0',
        ]);

        $product = new Product();
        $product->name = $request->name;
        $product->cat_id = $request->cat_id;
        $product->amount = $request->amount;
        $product->details = $request->details;
        $product->stock = $request->stock;

        if ($request->hasFile('image')) {
            $path = $request->file('image')->store('products', 'public');
            $product->image = $path;
        }

        $product->save();

        return redirect()->route('product.list')
                        ->with('success', 'Product created successfully!');
    }
}
```

#### 5.2.3 Shopping Cart System

**CartService Implementation:**
```php
<?php
namespace App\Services;

use App\Models\CartItem;
use App\Models\Product;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

class CartService
{
    public function add($productId, $quantity = 1, $options = [])
    {
        $product = Product::findOrFail($productId);
        
        if (!$product->isInStock()) {
            throw new \Exception('Product is out of stock');
        }

        $userId = Auth::id();
        
        $cartItem = CartItem::where('user_id', $userId)
                           ->where('product_id', $productId)
                           ->first();

        if ($cartItem) {
            $cartItem->quantity += $quantity;
            $cartItem->save();
        } else {
            CartItem::create([
                'user_id' => $userId,
                'product_id' => $productId,
                'quantity' => $quantity,
                'price' => $product->amount,
                'options' => $options
            ]);
        }
    }

    public function get()
    {
        return CartItem::with('product')
                      ->where('user_id', Auth::id())
                      ->get();
    }

    public function count()
    {
        return CartItem::where('user_id', Auth::id())->sum('quantity');
    }

    public function total()
    {
        return CartItem::with('product')
                      ->where('user_id', Auth::id())
                      ->get()
                      ->sum(function($item) {
                          return $item->quantity * $item->product->amount;
                      });
    }
}
```

**Cart Controller:**
```php
<?php
namespace App\Http\Controllers\Cart;

use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use App\Services\CartService;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class CartController extends Controller
{
    protected $cartService;

    public function __construct(CartService $cartService)
    {
        $this->cartService = $cartService;
    }

    public function add(Request $request)
    {
        $request->validate([
            'product_id' => 'required|integer',
            'quantity' => 'integer|min:1'
        ]);

        try {
            $this->cartService->add(

            'cancelled' => 'danger'
        ];

        return $colors[$this->status] ?? 'secondary';
    }
}
```

### 5.3 Frontend Implementation

#### 5.3.1 Responsive Design Implementation

The frontend utilizes Bootstrap CSS framework for responsive design, ensuring compatibility across different device types:

**Main Layout Structure:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>@yield('title', 'CODETREE - eCommerce')</title>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0/css/all.min.css">
    <meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}">
</head>
<body>
    @include('frontend.include.header')
    
    <main>
        @yield('content')
    </main>
    
    @include('frontend.include.footer')
    
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
    @stack('scripts')
</body>
</html>
```

#### 5.3.2 Dynamic Cart Functionality

**AJAX Cart Implementation:**
```javascript
function addToCart(productId, quantity = 1) {
    const csrfToken = document.querySelector('meta[name="csrf-token"]').content;
    
    fetch('/cart/add', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'X-CSRF-TOKEN': csrfToken,
            'Accept': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            product_id: productId,
            quantity: quantity
        })
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        if (data.success) {
            updateCartCount(data.cart_count);
            showNotification('Product added to cart!', 'success');
            loadCartFromServer(); // Refresh cart display
        } else {
            showNotification(data.message, 'error');
        }
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error:', error);
        showNotification('An error occurred. Please try again.', 'error');
    });
}

function updateCartCount(count) {
    const cartCountElements = document.querySelectorAll('[data-cart-count]');
    cartCountElements.forEach(element => {
        element.textContent = count;
    });
}
```

### 5.4 Database Migration and Seeding

#### 5.4.1 Migration Files

Laravel migrations provide version control for the database schema:

**Product Categories Migration:**
```php
<?php
use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

return new class extends Migration
{
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('product_categories', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            $table->string('name');
            $table->text('description')->nullable();
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }

    public function down()
    {
        Schema::dropIfExists('product_categories');
    }
};
```

**Products Migration:**
```php
<?php
use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

return new class extends Migration
{
    public function up(): void
    {
        Schema::create('products', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            $table->string('name');
            $table->foreignId('cat_id')->constrained('product_categories')->onDelete('cascade');
            $table->decimal('amount', 10, 2);
            $table->text('details')->nullable();
            $table->string('image')->nullable();
            $table->integer('stock')->default(0);
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }

    public function down(): void
    {
        Schema::dropIfExists('products');
    }
};
```

### 5.5 Security Implementation

#### 5.5.1 Input Validation and Sanitization

Laravel's validation system is implemented throughout the application:

```php
public function create(Request $request)
{
    $request->validate([
        'name' => 'required|string|max:255|regex:/^[a-zA-Z0-9\s\-_.]+$/',
        'email' => 'required|email|unique:users,email',
        'password' => 'required|string|min:8|confirmed',
        'amount' => 'required|numeric|min:0|max:999999.99',
        'cat_id' => 'required|exists:product_categories,id',
        'image' => 'nullable|image|mimes:jpeg,png,jpg,gif|max:2048'
    ]);
}
```

#### 5.5.2 CSRF Protection

Cross-Site Request Forgery protection is implemented using Laravel's built-in middleware:

```html
<form method="POST" action="{{ route('product.create') }}">
    @csrf
    <!-- Form fields -->
</form>
```

#### 5.5.3 Authentication Middleware

Role-based access control is implemented through custom middleware:

```php
<?php
namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

class AdminMiddleware
{
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
    {
        if (!Auth::check() || !Auth::user()->isAdmin()) {
            return redirect()->route('login')->with('error', 'Access denied');
        }

        return $next($request);
    }
}
```
